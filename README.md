A small two week project between other coursework for an experimental game design class. This is prototype rather than a full game, but I might come back to this later.

The premake code is sourced from https://github.com/raylib-extras/game-premake.

Since this isn't a finished product in any way, the only build in bin right now is the debug arm Mac build. It's merely a test of velocity modifying window size. Press esc to close to program if you decide to build and run it.

vector_generator.ipynb is just so I can easily convert any image into a 0 1 vector grid to be the collision field.
